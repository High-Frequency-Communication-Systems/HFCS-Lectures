  \frametitle{Constitutive Relationships - Simple Materials}
    How the flux densities (electric $\va{D}$, magnetic $\va{B}$) and field intensities (electric $\va{E}$, magnetic $\va{H}$) are related.

  For simple (isotropic) materials, we have a simple linear relationship:
  \begin{align*}
    \va{D} &= \E \va{E} \; [\si{\coulomb \per \m \squared}] \tag{Dielectric Material} \\
    \va{B} &= \u \va{H} \; [\si{\weber \per \m \squared}] \tag{Magnetic Material} \\
    \va{J} &= \sigma \va{E} \; [\si{\ampere \per \m \squared}]
  \end{align*}
  \begin{outline}
    \1 $\E$ and $\u$ are the permittivity and permeability of a given material respectively. For simple (isotropic and homogeneous) materials, these are real numbers.
    \1 At higher frequencies, we need to consider the material polarizability.

  \frametitle{Further Material Properties}

\begin{outline}
  \1 We can extract many material properties from $\E$ and $\u$.
\end{outline}
The speed of light:
  \begin{align*}
    c &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\u \E}}
  \end{align*}

The characteristic impedance:
\begin{align*}
    \eta &= \sqrt{\frac{\u}{\E}}
  \end{align*}

The refractive index:
\begin{align*}
    n &= \sqrt{{\u}{\E}}
  \end{align*}

  \begin{outline}
    \1 Most materials are considered non-magnetic ($\u_r = 1$).
    \1 Further properties at nanoscale EM

  \frametitle{Some Complex Materials}

In real life, there are many types of media. Generally,
\begin{align*}
  \va{D}(\va{r}, t) &= \E(\va{r}) \va{E}(\va{r}, t)  [\si{\coulomb \per \m \squared}]
\end{align*}

Anisotropic materials:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
D_{x} \\
D_{y} \\
D_{z}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\E_{x x} & \E_{x y} & \E_{x z} \\
\E_{y x} & \E_{y y} & \E_{y z} \\
\E_{z x} & \E_{z y} & \E_{z z}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
E_{x} \\
E_{y} \\
E_{z}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

The permittivity $\E$ is a tensor (or matrix) as properties depend on the direction.

For media with loss, $\E$ is a complex number.
