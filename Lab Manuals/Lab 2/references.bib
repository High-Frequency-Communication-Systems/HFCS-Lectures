  abstract = {Maxwell's equations are replaced by a set of finite difference equations. It is shown that if one chooses the field points appropriately, the set of finite difference equations is applicable for a boundary condition involving perfectly conducting surfaces. An example is given of the scattering of an electromagnetic pulse by a perfectly conducting cylinder.},

Itcan simulate the transmitting process of clastic surface waves and body waves incident atarbitrary angles under any accuracy required. It may be used for two- or three-dimensionaltransient wave analyses in laterally heterogeneous media and easily incorporated into exist-ing finite element or finite difference computational codes.},
