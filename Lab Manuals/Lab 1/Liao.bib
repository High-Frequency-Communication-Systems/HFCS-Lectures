	abstract = {An artificial boundary condition at the edge of finite computational grids is devised. Itcan simulate the transmitting process of clastic surface waves and body waves incident atarbitrary angles under any accuracy required. It may be used for two- or three-dimensionaltransient wave analyses in laterally heterogeneous media and easily incorporated into exist-ing finite element or finite difference computational codes.},
